Description: This is a compact open source OpenFlow controller (Python 3)
 This is a compact open source OpenFlow controller, which enables network
 operators to run their networks the same way they do server clusters.
 Faucet moves network control functions
 (like routing protocols, neighbor discovery, and switching algorithms)
 to vendor independent server-based software,
 versus traditional router or switch embedded firmware,
 where those functions are easy to manage, test, and extend with modern
 systems management best practices and tools.

Description: This is a component the Faucet OpenFlow controller (Python 3)
 This is a component of the Faucet OpenFlow controller,
 maintains an OpenFlow connection to switches and monitors port and flow
 state (exporting it to Prometheus or InfluxDB, or even flat text log files).
 Gauge does not ever modify the switch’s state, so that switch monitoring
 functions can be upgraded, restarted, without impacting forwarding.
