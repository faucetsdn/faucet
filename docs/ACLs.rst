ACLs tutorial
=============

In the `first tutorial <tutorials.html>`_ we covered how to install and set-up Faucet.
Next we are going to introduce Access Control Lists (ACLs).


ETA: ~25 minutes.

Prerequisites:
--------------

- Faucet - `Package installation steps 1 & 2 <https://faucet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html#package-installation>`__
- OpenVSwitch - `Connect your first datapath steps 1 & 2 <https://faucet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html#connect-your-first-datapath>`__
- Useful Bash Functions - Copy and paste the following definitions into your bash terminal, or to make them persistent between sessions add them to the bottom of your .bashrc and run 'source .bashrc'.

.. literalinclude:: _static/tutorial/create_ns


.. literalinclude:: _static/tutorial/as_ns

.. literalinclude:: _static/tutorial/cleanup

To make these functions persistent between sessions add them to the bottom of your .bashrc and run 'source .bashrc'.

.. note:: If not continuing on from the 'Installing Faucet for first time tutorial' to setup the hosts and switch run:

    .. code:: bash

        create_ns host1 192.168.0.1/24
        create_ns host2 192.168.0.2/24
        sudo ovs-vsctl add-br br0 \
        -- set bridge br0 other-config:datapath-id=0000000000000001 \
        -- set bridge br0 other-config:disable-in-band=true \
        -- set bridge br0 fail_mode=secure \
        -- add-port br0 veth-host1 -- set interface veth-host1 ofport_request=1 \
        -- add-port br0 veth-host2 -- set interface veth-host2 ofport_request=2 \
        -- set-controller br0 tcp:127.0.0.1:6653 tcp:127.0.0.1:6654

    And the faucet.yaml configuration file looks like:

    .. code-block:: yaml
        :caption: /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml

        vlans:
            office:

                description: "office network"

        dps:
            sw1:

                interfaces:
                    1:
                        name: "host1"
                        description: "host2 network namespace"
                        native_vlan: office
                    2:
                        name: "host2"
                        description: "host2 network namespace"
                        native_vlan: office

Overview
--------

Faucet ACLs are made up of lists of rules.
The order of the rules in the list denote the priority with the first rules being highest and last lowest.
Each of these lists has a name (e.g. 'block-ping'), and can be used on multiple port or VLAN 'acls_in' fields.
Again these are applied in order so all of 'block-ping' rules will be higher than 'allow-all'.

Each rule contains two main items 'matches' and 'actions'.
Matches are any packet field such as MAC/IP/transport source/destination fields.
For a full list visit https://ryu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ofproto_v1_3_ref.html#flow-match-structure

Actions are used to control what the packet does, for example normal l2 forwarding ('allow').
Apply a 'meter' to rate limit traffic, and manipulation of the packet contents and output.
Full list https://faucet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#id13

The example below has defined two ACLs 'block-ping' & 'allow-all' these can be used on any and multiple ports or VLANs (more on VLANs later) using the 'acls_in' key.
The block-ping ACL has two rules, one to block ICMP on IPv4 and another for ICMPv6 on IPv6.
The allow-all ACL has one rule, which specifies no match fields, and therefore matches all packets, and the action 'allow'.
The 'allow' action is a boolean, if it's True allow the packet to continue through the Faucet pipeline, if False drop the packet.
'allow' can be used in conjunction with the other actions to let the traffic flow with the expected layer 2 forwarding behaviour AND be mirrored to another port.


Network Setup
-------------
We are going to create the following network:

.. image:: _static/images/acls.svg
    :alt: ACL network diagram
    :align: center

First we will add two new hosts to our network:

.. code:: console

    create_ns host3 192.168.0.3/24
    create_ns host4 192.168.0.4/24

And connect them to br0

.. code-block:: console

    sudo ovs-vsctl add-port br0 veth-host3 -- set interface veth-host3 ofport_request=3 \
        -- add-port br0 veth-host4 -- set interface veth-host4 ofport_request=4


The configuration below will block ICMP on traffic coming in on port 3, and allow everything else.
Add this to /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml below the 'dps'.

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml

                3:
                    name: "host3"
                    native_vlan: office
                    acls_in: [block-ping, allow-all]
                4:
                    name: "host4"
                    native_vlan: office
    acls:
        block-ping:
            - rule:
                dl_type: 0x800      # IPv4
                ip_proto: 1         # ICMP
                actions:
                    allow: False
            - rule:
                dl_type: 0x86dd     # IPv6
                ip_proto: 58        # ICMPv6
                actions:
                    allow: False
        allow-all:
            - rule:
                actions:
                    allow: True


Now tell Faucet to reload its configuration, this can be done by restarting the application.
But a better way is to send Faucet a SIGHUP signal.

.. code:: console

    check_faucet_config /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml


.. code:: console

    sudo systemctl reload faucet


Now pings to/from host3 should fail, but the other three hosts should be fine.

Test this with

.. code:: console

    as_ns host1 ping 192.168.0.3
    as_ns host1 ping 192.168.0.4


ACL Actions
-----------

Mirroring
+++++++++

Mirroring traffic is useful if we want to send it to an out of band NFV service (e.g. Intrusion Detection System, packet capture a port or VLAN).
To do this Faucet provides two ACL actions: mirror & output.

The mirror action copies the packet, before any modifications, to the specified port (NOTE: mirroring is done in input direction only).

Let's add the mirror action to our block-ping ACL /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml

    ...
        block-ping:
            - rule:
                dl_type: 0x800
                ip_proto: 1
                actions:
                    allow: False
                    mirror: 4
            - rule:
                dl_type: 0x86dd
                ip_proto: 58
                actions:
                    allow: False
                    mirror: 4

And again send the sighup signal to Faucet

.. code:: console

    sudo systemctl reload faucet

To check this we will ping from host1 to host3, while performing a tcpdump on host4 who should receive the ping replies.
It is a good idea to run each from a different terminal (screen, tmux, ...)

.. code:: console

    as_ns host4 tcpdump -l -e -n -i veth0


.. code:: console

    as_ns host1 ping 192.168.0.3

Ping should have 100% packet loss.


.. code:: console

    $ as_ns host4 tcpdump -l -e -n -i veth0
    tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
    listening on veth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
    13:24:36.848331 2e:d4:1a:ca:54:4b > 06:5f:14:fc:47:02, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 192.168.0.3 > 192.168.0.1: ICMP echo reply, id 23660, seq 16, length 64
    13:24:37.857024 2e:d4:1a:ca:54:4b > 06:5f:14:fc:47:02, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 192.168.0.3 > 192.168.0.1:   ICMP echo reply, id 23660, seq 17, length 64
    13:24:38.865005 2e:d4:1a:ca:54:4b > 06:5f:14:fc:47:02, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 192.168.0.3 > 192.168.0.1: ICMP echo reply, id 23660, seq 18, length 64
    13:24:39.873377 2e:d4:1a:ca:54:4b > 06:5f:14:fc:47:02, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 192.168.0.3 > 192.168.0.1: ICMP echo reply, id 23660, seq 19, length 64
    13:24:40.881129 2e:d4:1a:ca:54:4b > 06:5f:14:fc:47:02, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 192.168.0.3 > 192.168.0.1: ICMP echo reply, id 23660, seq 20, length 64


Output
++++++

There is also the 'output' action which can be used to achieve the same thing.

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml

    block-ping:
        - rule:
            dl_type: 0x800
            ip_proto: 1
            actions:
                allow: False
                output:
                    port: 4
        - rule:
            dl_type: 0x86dd
            ip_proto: 58
            actions:
                allow: False
                output:
                    port: 4


The output action also allows us to change the packet by setting fields (mac/ip addresses, ...), VLAN operations (push/pop/swap VIDs).
It can be used in conjunction with the other actions, e.g. output directly and but do not allow through the Faucet pipeline (allow: false).

Let's create a new ACL for host2's port that will change the MAC source address.


.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml

    dps:
        sw1:
            ...
            2:
                name: "host2"
                description: "host2 network namespace"
                native_vlan: office
                acls_in: [rewrite-mac, allow-all]
            ...
    acls:
        rewrite-mac:
            - rule:
                actions:
                    allow: True
                    output:
                        set_fields:
                            - eth_src: "00:00:00:00:00:02"
    ...


Again reload Faucet.

Start tcpdump on host1

.. code:: console

    as_ns host1 tcpdump -l -e -n -i veth0

Ping host1 from host2

.. code:: console

    as_ns host2 ping 192.168.0.1

Here we can see ICMP echo requests are coming from the MAC address "00:00:00:00:00:02" that we set in our output ACL.
(The reply is destined to the actual MAC address of host2 thanks to ARP).

.. code:: console

    tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
    listening on veth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
    13:53:41.248235 00:00:00:00:00:02 > 06:5f:14:fc:47:02, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 192.168.0.2 > 192.168.0.1: ICMP echo request, id 23711, seq 1, length 64

    13:53:43.249726 00:00:00:00:00:02 > 06:5f:14:fc:47:02, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 192.168.0.2 > 192.168.0.1: ICMP echo request, id 23711, seq 3, length 64
    13:53:43.249757 06:5f:14:fc:47:02 > ce:bb:23:ce:d5:a0, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 192.168.0.1 > 192.168.0.2: ICMP echo reply, id 23711, seq 3, length 64
    13:53:44.248713 00:00:00:00:00:02 > 06:5f:14:fc:47:02, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 192.168.0.2 > 192.168.0.1: ICMP echo request, id 23711, seq 4, length 64
    13:53:44.248738 06:5f:14:fc:47:02 > ce:bb:23:ce:d5:a0, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 192.168.0.1 > 192.168.0.2: ICMP echo reply, id 23711, seq 4, length 64



With the output action we could also use it to mirror traffic to a NFV server (like our fake mirror output action above), and use a VLAN tag to identify what port the traffic originated on on the switch.
To do this we will use both the 'port' & 'vlan_vid' output fields.

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml

    block-ping:
        - rule:
            dl_type: 0x800
            ip_proto: 1
            actions:
                allow: False
                output:
                    vlan_vid: 3
                    port: 4
        - rule:
            dl_type: 0x86dd
            ip_proto: 58
            actions:
                allow: False
                output:
                    vlan_vid: 3
                    port: 4


Again reload Faucet, start a tcpdump on host4, and ping from host1 to host3.
Ping should still not be allowed through and the tcpdump output should be similar to below (Note the 802.1Q tag and vlan 3):

.. code:: console

    $ as_ns host4 tcpdump -l -e -n -i veth0
    tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
    listening on veth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes

    14:14:16.293016 2e:d4:1a:ca:54:4b > 06:5f:14:fc:47:02, ethertype 802.1Q (0x8100), length 102: vlan 3, p 0, ethertype IPv4, 192.168.0.3 > 192.168.0.1: ICMP echo reply, id 23747, seq 2, length 64
    14:14:17.300898 2e:d4:1a:ca:54:4b > 06:5f:14:fc:47:02, ethertype 802.1Q (0x8100), length 102: vlan 3, p 0, ethertype IPv4, 192.168.0.3 > 192.168.0.1: ICMP echo reply, id 23747, seq 3, length 64
