.. _faucet-docker-install:

Installation with Docker
------------------------

We provide official automated builds on `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/faucet/>`_ so that you can easily
run Faucet and it's components in a self-contained environment without installing on the main host system.

.. _docker-install:

Installing docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend installing Docker Community Edition (CE) according to the official
`docker engine installation guide <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation>`_.

Configuring dockers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, we need to create some configuration files on our host to mount inside
the docker containers to configure faucet and gauge:

.. code:: console

  sudo mkdir -p /etc/faucet
  sudo vi /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml
  sudo vi /etc/faucet/gauge.yaml

See the :doc:`configuration` section for configuration options.

Starting dockers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use Docker tags to differentiate between versions of Faucet. The latest
tag will always point to the latest stable release of Faucet. All tagged
versions of Faucet in git are also available to use, for example using the
``faucet/faucet:1.8.0`` Docker will run the released version 1.8.0 of Faucet.

By default the Faucet and Gauge images are run as the `faucet` user under
UID 0, GID 0. If you need to change that it can be overridden at runtime with
the Docker flags: ``-e LOCAL_USER_ID`` and ``-e LOCAL_GROUP_ID``.

To pull and run the latest version of Faucet:

.. code:: console

  mkdir -p /var/log/faucet/
  docker pull faucet/faucet:latest
  docker run -d \
      --name faucet \
      --restart=always \
      -v /etc/faucet/:/etc/faucet/ \
      -v /var/log/faucet/:/var/log/faucet/ \
      -p 6653:6653 \
      -p 9302:9302 \
      faucet/faucet

Port 6653 is used for OpenFlow, port 9302 is used for Prometheus - port 9302
may be omitted if you do not need Prometheus.

To pull and run the latest version of Gauge:

.. code:: console

  mkdir -p /var/log/faucet/gauge/
  docker pull faucet/gauge:latest
  docker run -d \
      --name gauge \
      --restart=always \
      -v /etc/faucet/:/etc/faucet/ \
      -v /var/log/faucet/:/var/log/faucet/ \
      -p 6654:6653 \
      -p 9303:9303 \
      faucet/gauge

Port 6654 is used for OpenFlow, port 9303 is used for Prometheus - port 9303
may be omitted if you do not need Prometheus.

Additional arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may wish to run faucet under docker with additional arguments, for example:
setting certificates for an encrypted control channel. This can be done by
overriding the docker entrypoint like so:

.. code:: console

  docker run -d \
      --name faucet \
      --restart=always \
      -v /etc/faucet/:/etc/faucet/ \
      -v /etc/ryu/ssl/:/etc/ryu/ssl/ \
      -v /var/log/faucet/:/var/log/faucet/ \
      -p 6653:6653 \
      -p 9302:9302 \
      faucet/faucet \
      faucet \
      --ctl-privkey /etc/ryu/ssl/ctrlr.key \
      --ctl-cert /etc/ryu/ssl/ctrlr.cert  \
      --ca-certs /etc/ryu/ssl/sw.cert

You can get a list of all additional arguments faucet supports by running:

.. code:: console

  docker run -it faucet/faucet faucet --help

Docker compose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an example docker-compose file that can be used to set up gauge to talk
to Prometheus and InfluxDB with a Grafana instance for dashboards and visualisations.

It can be run with:

.. code:: console

  docker-compose pull
  docker-compose up

The time-series databases with the default settings will write to
``/opt/prometheus/`` ``/opt/influxdb/shared/data/db`` you can edit these locations
by modifying the ``docker-compose.yaml`` file.

On OSX, some of the default shared paths are not accessible, so to overwrite
the location that volumes are written to on your host, export an environment
varible name ``FAUCET_PREFIX`` and it will get prepended to the host paths.
For example:

.. code:: bash

  export FAUCET_PREFIX=/opt/faucet

When all the docker containers are running we will need to configure Grafana to
talk to Prometheus and InfluxDB. First login to the Grafana web interface on
port 3000 (e.g http://localhost:3000) using the default credentials of
``admin:admin``.

Then add two data sources. Use the following settings for prometheus:

::

  Name: Prometheus
  Type: Prometheus
  Url: http://prometheus:9090

And the following settings for InfluxDB:

::

  Name: InfluxDB
  Type: InfluxDB
  Url: http://influxdb:8086
  With Credentials: true
  Database: faucet
  User: faucet
  Password: faucet

Check the connection using test connection.

From here you can add a new dashboard and a graphs for pulling data from the
data sources. Hover over the ``+`` button on the left sidebar in the web
interface and click ``Import``.

We will import the following dashboards, just download the following
links and upload them through the grafana dashboard import screen:

* `Instrumentation <_static/grafana-dashboards/faucet_instrumentation.json>`_
* `Inventory <_static/grafana-dashboards/faucet_inventory.json>`_
* `Port Statistics <_static/grafana-dashboards/faucet_port_statistics.json>`_

.. _faucet-pip-install:

Installation with Pip
---------------------

You can install the latest pip package, or you can install directly from git via pip.

Installing faucet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, install some python dependencies:

.. code:: console

  apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip
  pip3 install setuptools
  pip3 install wheel

Then install the latest stable release of faucet from pypi, via pip:

.. code:: console

  pip3 install faucet

Or, install the latest development code from git, via pip:

.. code:: console

  pip3 install git+https://github.com/faucetsdn/faucet.git

Starting faucet manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Faucet includes a start up script for starting Faucet and Gauge easily from the
command line.

To run Faucet manually:

.. code:: console

  faucet --verbose

To run Gauge manually:

.. code:: console

  gauge --verbose

There are a number of options that you can supply the start up script for
changing various options such as OpenFlow port and setting up an encrypted
control channel. You can find a list of the additional arguments by running:

.. code:: console

  faucet --help


Starting faucet With systemd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Systemd can be used to start Faucet and Gauge at boot automatically:

.. code:: console

    $EDITOR /etc/systemd/system/faucet.service
    $EDITOR /etc/systemd/system/gauge.service
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl enable faucet.service
    systemctl enable gauge.service
    systemctl restart faucet
    systemctl restart gauge

``/etc/systemd/system/faucet.service`` should contain:

.. literalinclude:: ../etc/systemd/system/faucet.service
  :language: shell
  :caption: faucet.service
  :name: faucet.service

``/etc/systemd/system/gauge.service`` should contain:

.. literalinclude:: ../etc/systemd/system/gauge.service
  :language: shell
  :caption: gauge.service
  :name: gauge.service

.. _faucet-raspbian-install:

Installing on Raspberry Pi
--------------------------

We provide a Raspberry Pi image running FAUCET which can be retrieved from the `latest faucet release <https://github.com/faucetsdn/faucet/releases/latest>`_
page on GitHub. Download the faucet_VERSION_raspbian-lite.zip file.

The image can then be copied onto an SD card following the same steps from the official `Raspberry Pi installation guide <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md>`_.

Once you have booted up the Raspberry Pi and logged in using the default credentials you can follow through the :doc:`../tutorials/first_time` tutorial starting from :ref:`tutorial-configure-prometheus` to properly configure each component.

.. note::
	It is strongly recommended to use a Raspberry Pi 3 or better.

.. _faucet-vm-install:

Intalling with Virtual Machine image
------------------------------------

We provide a VM image for running FAUCET for development and learning purposes.
The VM comes pre-installed with FAUCET, GAUGE, prometheus and grafana.

Openstack's `diskimage-builder <https://docs.openstack.org/diskimage-builder/latest/>`_
(DIB) is used to build the VM images in many formats (qcow2,tgz,squashfs,vhd,raw).

Downloading pre-built images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pre-built images are available on github, see the `latest faucet release <https://github.com/faucetsdn/faucet/releases/latest>`_
page on GitHub and download the faucet-amd64-VERSION.qcow2 file.

Building the images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't want to use our `pre-built images <https://github.com/faucetsdn/faucet/releases/latest>`_, you can build them yourself:

1. `Install the latest disk-image-builder <https://docs.openstack.org/diskimage-builder/latest/user_guide/installation.html>`_
2. `Install a patched vhd-util <https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ci-core/+archive/ubuntu/vhd-util>`_
3. Run build-faucet-vm.sh

Security considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This VM is not secure by default, it includes no firewall and has a number of
network services listening on all interfaces with weak passwords. It also
includes a backdoor user (faucet) with weak credentials.

**Services**

The VM exposes a number of ports listening on all interfaces by default:

======================== ====
Service                  Port
======================== ====
SSH                      22
Faucet OpenFlow Channel  6653
Gauge OpenFlow Channel   6654
Grafana Web Interface    3000
Prometheus Web Interface 9090
======================== ====

**Default Credentials**

===================== ======== ========
Service               Username Password
===================== ======== ========
VM TTY Console        faucet   faucet
SSH                   faucet   faucet
Grafana Web Interface admin    admin
===================== ======== ========

Post-install steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Grafana comes installed but unconfigured, you will need to login to the grafana
web interface at ``http://VM_IP:3000`` and configure a data source and some dashboards.

After logging in with the default credentials shown above, the first step is to add a `prometheus data source <https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/#creating-a-prometheus-data-source>`_,
use the following settings then click ``Save & Test``:

  ::

      Name:   Prometheus
      Type:   Prometheus
      URL:    http://localhost:9090

Next we want to add some dashboards so that we can later view the metrics
from faucet.

Hover over the ``+`` button on the left sidebar in the web interface
and click ``Import``.

We will import the following dashboards, just download the following
links and upload them through the grafana dashboard import screen:

* `Instrumentation <_static/grafana-dashboards/faucet_instrumentation.json>`_
* `Inventory <_static/grafana-dashboards/faucet_inventory.json>`_
* `Port Statistics <_static/grafana-dashboards/faucet_port_statistics.json>`_

You will need to supply your own faucet.yaml and gauge.yaml configuration in the VM.
There are samples provided at /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml and /etc/faucet/gauge.yaml.

Finally you will need to point one of the supported OpenFlow vendors at the controller VM,
port 6653 is the Faucet OpenFlow control channel and 6654 is the Gauge OpennFlow control channel for monitoring.
