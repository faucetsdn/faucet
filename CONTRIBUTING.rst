============
Contributing
============
There is no formal process for contributions. Feel free to submit an issue or a
pull request if you so desire. These will be reviewed by Brad, Josh or Kit.
We'll either accept, close or offer feedback (or some combination).

Code should pass all tests.

For more detail see README.developerguide.rst in the docs directory

Licensing
=========
This got a bit messy, so in the interest of clarifying things and tidying this
up:

All patches must be submitted under the Apache 2.0 License. Ownership of
copyright of patches is retained by their licensors. When you are submitting a
patch for a file with an existing copyright assertion other than to 'The
Contributors' or to a file with no copyright assertion at all, you may add an
additional copyright assertion on behalf of 'The Contributors' (with an Apache
2.0 license statement). Any other copyright assertion should not be added other
than in exceptional circumstances.

And add yourself (and any other contributors) to the AUTHORS file when you
first make a contribution.
