Configuration
=============

Faucet is configured with a YAML-based configuration file, ``faucet.yaml``.
The following is example demonstrating a few common features:

.. literalinclude:: ../etc/faucet/faucet.yaml
  :language: yaml
  :caption: faucet.yaml
  :name: faucet.yaml

.. literalinclude:: ../etc/faucet/acls.yaml
  :language: yaml
  :caption: acls.yaml
  :name: acls.yaml

The datapath ID may be specified as an integer or hex string (beginning with 0x).

A port not explicitly defined in the YAML configuration file will be left down and will drop all packets.

Gauge is configured similarly with, ``gauge.yaml``.
The following is example demonstrating a few common features:

.. literalinclude:: ../etc/faucet/gauge.yaml
  :language: yaml
  :caption: gauge.yaml
  :name: gauge.yaml

Verifying configuration
-----------------------

You can verify that your configuration is correct with the ``check_faucet_config`` script:

.. code:: console

  check_faucet_config /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml

Configuration examples
----------------------

For complete working examples of configuration features, see the unit tests, ``tests/faucet_mininet_test.py``.
For example, ``FaucetUntaggedACLTest`` shows how to configure an ACL to block a TCP port,
``FaucetTaggedIPv4RouteTest`` shows how to configure static IPv4 routing.

Applying configuration updates
------------------------------

You can update FAUCET's configuration by sending it a HUP signal.
This will cause it to apply the minimum number of flow changes to the switch(es), to implement the change.

.. code:: console

  pkill -HUP -f faucet.faucet

Configuration in separate files
-------------------------------

Extra DP, VLAN or ACL data can also be separated into different files and included into the main configuration file, as shown below. The ``include`` field is used for configuration files which are required to be loaded, and Faucet will log an error if there was a problem while loading a file. Files listed on ``include-optional`` will simply be skipped and a warning will be logged instead.

Files are parsed in order, and both absolute and relative (to the configuration file) paths are allowed. DPs, VLANs or ACLs defined in subsequent files overwrite previously defined ones with the same name.

``faucet.yaml``

.. code:: yaml

  include:
      - /etc/faucet/dps.yaml
      - /etc/faucet/vlans.yaml

  include-optional:
      - acls.yaml

``dps.yaml``

.. code:: yaml

  # Recursive include is allowed, if needed.
  # Again, relative paths are relative to this configuration file.
  include-optional:
      - override.yaml

  dps:
      test-switch-1:
          ...
      test-switch-2:
          ...

DP
~~
DP configuration is entered in the 'dps' configuration block. The 'dps'
configuration contains a dictionary of configuration blocks each
containing the configuration for one datapath. The keys can either be
string names given to the datapath, or the OFP datapath id.

.. list-table:: dps: <dp name or id>: {}
    :widths: 31 15 15 60
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Attribute
      - Type
      - Default
      - Description
    * - arp_neighbor_timeout
      - type
      - 500
      - ARP and neighbour timeout in seconds

      - The configuration key
      - the OFP datapath-id of this datapath
    * - drop_bpdu
      - boolean
      - True
      - If True, Faucet will drop all STP BPDUs arriving at the datapath. NB:
        Faucet does not handle BPDUs itself, if you disable this then you
        either need to configure an ACL to catch BDPUs or Faucet will forward
        them as though they were normal traffic.
    * - drop_broadcast_source_address
      - boolean
      - True
      - If True, Faucet will drop any packet from a broadcast source address
    * - drop_lldp
      - boolean

        source address equal to a MAC address that Faucet is using.
    * - group_table
      - bool
      - False
      - If True, Faucet will use the OpenFlow Group tables to flood packets.
        This is an experimental feature that is not fully supported by all

      - 3
      - Ignore every approx nth packet for learning. 2 will ignore 1 out of 2
        packets; 3 will ignore 1 out of 3 packets. This limits control plane
        activity when learning new hosts rapidly. Flooding will still be done
        by the dataplane even with a packet is ignored for learning purposes.
    * - interfaces
      - dictionary
      - {}
      - configuration block for interface specific config (see below)
    * - interface_ranges
      - dictionary
      - {}
      - contains the config blocks for sets of multiple interfaces. The
        configuration entered here will be used as the defaults for these
        interfaces.  The defaults can be overwritten by configuring the
        interfaces individually, which will also inherit all defaults not
        specifically configured.
        For example, if the range specifies tagged_vlans: [1, 2, 3], and the
        individual interface specifies tagged_vlans: [4], the result will be
        tagged_vlans: [4]. The format for the configuration key is a comma
        separated string.  The elements can either be the name or number of
        an interface or a range of port numbers eg: "1-6,8,port9".
    * - learn_ban_timeout
      - integer
      - 10
      - When a host is rapidly moving between ports Faucet will stop learning
        mac addresses on one of the ports for this number of seconds.
    * - learn_jitter
      - integer
      - 10
      - In order to reduce load on the controller Faucet will randomly vary the
        timeout for learnt mac addresses by up to this number of seconds.
    * - lldp_beacon
      - dict
      - {}
      - Configuration block for LLDP beacons
    * - max_host_fib_retry_count
      - integer

      - configuration block for stacking config, for loop protection (see
        below)
    * - timeout
      - integer
      - 300
      - timeout for MAC address learning
    * - targeted_gw_resolution

      - if True, and a gateway has been resolved, target the first re-resolution attempt to the same port rather than flooding.
    * - minimum_ip_size_check
      - bool
      - True
      - If False, don't check that IP packets have a payload (must be False for OVS trace/tutorial to work)


Stacking (DP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Stacking is configured in the dp configuration block and in the interface
configuration block. At the dp level the following attributes can be configured
withing the configuration block 'stack':

.. list-table:: dps: <dp name or id>: stack: {}
    :widths: 31 15 15 60
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Attribute
      - Type
      - Default
      - Description
    * - priority
      - integer
      - 0
      - setting any value for stack priority indicates that this datapath
        should be the root for the stacking topology.

LLDP (DP)
~~~~~~~~~
LLDP beacons are configured in the dp and interface configuration blocks.

Note: the LLDP beacon service is specifically NOT to discover topology. It is
intended to facilitate physical troubleshooting (e.g. a standard cable tester
can display OF port information). A seperate system will be used to probe
link/neighbor activity, addressing issues such as authenticity of the probes.

The following attributes can be configured withing the 'lldp_beacon'
configuration block at the dp level:

.. list-table:: dps: <dp name or id>: lldp_beacon: {}

      - seconds between sending beacons
    * - max_per_interval
      - integer
      - None
      - the maximum number of beacons, across all ports to send each interval

Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~
Configuration for each interface is entered in the 'interfaces' configuration
block withing the config for the datapath. Each interface configuration block
is a dictionary keyed by the interface name.

Defaults for groups of interfaces can also be configured under the
'interface-ranges' attribute within the datapath configuration block. These
provide default values for a number of interfaces which can be overwritten with
the config block for an individual interface. These are keyed with a string
containing a comma separated list of OFP port numbers, interface names or with
OFP port number ranges (eg. 1-6).

Failover is an experimental option, but can be configured as follows:

.. list-table:: : acls: <acl name>: - rule: actions: output: failover: {}
    :widths: 31 15 15 60
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Attribute
      - Type
      - Default
      - Description
    * - group_id
      - integer
      - None
      - The OFP group id to use for the failover group
    * - ports
      - list
      - None
      - The list of ports the packet can be output through.
